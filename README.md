## Projects

## Project Title: ADAS Data Annotation for Autonomous Driving Systems

## Overview

Worked on annotating and validating large-scale sensor data (images, videos, and LiDAR) to support machine learning models used in Advanced Driver Assistance Systems (ADAS) for autonomous and semi-autonomous vehicles. 





## Problem Statement

Raw sensor data from cameras and LiDAR cannot be directly understood by AI models. Without accurate annotations, ADAS systems fail to detect objects, lanes, and road conditions, leading to unsafe or unreliable driving decisions. 

## Data Annotator / Quality Analyst

## Responsibilities

Performed detailed data annotation on images, videos, and LiDAR point clouds using project-specific guidelines

Labeled objects such as vehicles, pedestrians, cyclists, traffic signs, traffic lights, lanes, and road boundaries

Conducted quality assurance (QA) checks to ensure annotation accuracy, consistency, and compliance with standards

Collaborated with QA and ML teams to correct errors and improve dataset quality

Identified edge cases, ambiguous data, and potential bias in datasets and reported findings to project leads

## Database:

Annotated datasets stored in structured formats (COCO, KITTI, YOLO, PASCAL VOC)

## Frameworks:

Computer Vision annotation frameworks

ML dataset pipelines for autonomous driving 



## Key Features

Bounding Box Annotation for object detection and collision avoidance

Semantic & Instance Segmentation for road, lane, and obstacle identification

Lane Annotation using polylines for lane departure and lane centering systems

LiDAR Point Cloud Annotation for 3D object detection and depth estimation

Multi-level Quality Assurance to ensure high dataset reliability 




## Outcome / Impact

Improved object detection and lane recognition accuracy for ADAS models

Reduced model errors by providing high-quality, consistent annotated datasets

Enabled safer driving decisions in autonomous systems through reliable training data

Contributed to scalable and production-ready AI datasets for real-world automotive applications
